# Aim

To study and understand the concepts of Sets and Dictionaries in Python, their characteristics, operations, and real-world applications.

# Detailed Theory
Introduction

Python provides several built-in data structures to store and manage data efficiently. Among them, Sets and Dictionaries are used when data needs to be stored in a unique or key-value form. This experiment focuses on understanding these two important data structures and their behavior.

# Sets in Python
What is a Set?

A set is an unordered collection of unique elements. Sets are used when duplication of data is not allowed and when fast membership testing is required.

Characteristics of Sets

Sets are unordered, meaning elements do not have a fixed position

Sets do not allow duplicate values

Sets are mutable, but their elements must be immutable

Indexing is not supported

Sets are optimized for fast searching and membership testing

Set Operations

Sets support mathematical operations such as:

Union

Intersection

Difference

Symmetric Difference

These operations make sets useful for comparing data and removing duplicates.

Applications of Sets

Removing duplicate values from data

Membership testing

Mathematical and logical operations

Data comparison tasks

# Dictionaries in Python
What is a Dictionary?

A dictionary is a collection of data stored in the form of key–value pairs. Each key is unique and is used to access its corresponding value.

Characteristics of Dictionaries

Dictionaries are unordered collections (logically key-based)

Data is stored as key–value pairs

Keys must be unique and immutable

Values can be of any data type

Dictionaries are mutable

Dictionary Operations

Common operations include:

Accessing values using keys

Adding new key–value pairs

Updating existing values

Removing elements

Iterating through keys and values

Applications of Dictionaries

Storing structured data

Representing real-world entities (student records, employee data, etc.)

Fast data lookup

Configuration and mapping tasks

# Difference Between Set and Dictionary
Feature	Set	Dictionary
Data Storage	Only values	Key–value pairs
Duplicate Values	Not allowed	Values allowed, keys unique
Indexing	Not supported	Accessed using keys
Use Case	Unique data storage	Structured data storage

# Experiment Description

In this experiment, the behavior and functionality of Sets and Dictionaries are studied. Their properties, operations, and use cases are analyzed to understand how Python efficiently manages unique and structured data.

# Requirements

Python Programming Environment

Basic knowledge of Python fundamentals

# Conclusion

The study of Sets and Dictionaries demonstrates their importance in Python programming. Sets are ideal for storing unique data and performing mathematical operations, while dictionaries provide an efficient way to store and retrieve structured information using key–value pairs. Understanding these data structures improves problem-solving efficiency and helps in designing optimized Python programs.

# Learning Outcome

Understanding of set and dictionary concepts

Knowledge of their characteristics and applications

Ability to choose appropriate data structures for different problemsply these concepts in real-life programming scenarios and future data analysis tasks.
